# 50dollars
_My own experimental version of an interesting math question_.

We were asked what would happen if ten people would receive 50 dollars each and after every _cycle_ they would give one random person a dollar from their own _stack_. 

The result is currently being spammed out in the console in a _**while(x > 0)**_ loop where the X is set to 1000 _(cycles)_.

**Possible updates:** 
- <s>Make a graphical interface to display the stack of dollars people have</s>.

     A graphical interface has now been implemented using SDL2.

- Create a better randomizer function. 
- Create a better sorting algorithm. _(Currently using standard library)_.
- Implement settings. _(Let the user choose how many cycles / people that should be created)_.
